  abstract = "The human hippocampus has been implicated in memory, in
              particular episodic or declarative memory. In rats, hippocampal
              lesions cause selective spatial deficits, and hippocampal complex
              spike cells (place cells) exhibit spatially localized firing,
              suggesting a role in spatial memory, although broader functions
              have also been suggested. Here we report the identification of
              the environmental features controlling the location and shape of
              the receptive fields (place fields) of the place cells. This was
              done by recording from the same cell in four rectangular boxes
              that differed solely in the length of one or both sides. Most of
              our results are explained by a model in which the place field is
              formed by the summation of gaussian tuning curves, each oriented
              perpendicular to a box wall and peaked at a fixed distance from
              it.",
