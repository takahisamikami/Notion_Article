  abstract = "Learners rely on a combination of experience-independent and

              environment. Language acquisition involves both types of
              mechanisms, but most theorists emphasize the relative importance
              of experience-independent mechanisms. The present study shows
              that a fundamental task of language acquisition, segmentation of
              words from fluent speech, can be accomplished by 8-month-old
              infants based solely on the statistical relationships between
              neighboring speech sounds. Moreover, this word segmentation was
              based on statistical learning from only 2 minutes of exposure,
              suggesting that infants have access to a powerful mechanism for
              the computation of statistical properties of the language input.",

              hand more extended for the small object. Infants contacted the

              the disjunctive syllogism: when a reward is hidden in one of two
              cups, and one cup is shown to be empty, they will search for the
              reward in the other cup. In Experiment 1, we extended these
              results to toddlers, finding that 23-month-olds consistently
              approached the non-empty location. However, these results could
              reflect non-deductive approaches of simply avoiding the empty
              location, or of searching in any location that might contain the
              reward, rather than reasoning through the disjunctive syllogism

              Experiment 2 addressed these alternatives, finding evidence that
              3- to 5-year-olds used the disjunctive syllogism, while

  abstract = "Over the last quarter century, the dominant tendency in
              comparative cognitive psychology has been to emphasize the
              similarities between human and nonhuman minds and to downplay the
              differences as ``one of degree and not of kind'' (Darwin 1871).
              In the present target article, we argue that Darwin was mistaken:
              the profound biological continuity between human and nonhuman
              animals masks an equally profound discontinuity between human and
              nonhuman minds. To wit, there is a significant discontinuity in
              the degree to which human and nonhuman animals are able to
              approximate the higher-order, systematic, relational capabilities
              of a physical symbol system (PSS) (Newell 1980). We show that
              this symbolic-relational discontinuity pervades nearly every
              domain of cognition and runs much deeper than even the
              spectacular scaffolding provided by language or culture alone can
              explain. We propose a representational-level specification as to
              where human and nonhuman animals' abilities to approximate a PSS
              are similar and where they differ. We conclude by suggesting that
              recent symbolic-connectionist models of cognition shed new light

              representations to frame and prune hypotheses. By presenting
              scenes containing ambiguities about the identity of an object,
              here we show that 12- and 19-month-old infants look longer at
              outcomes that are inconsistent with a logical inference necessary
              to resolve such ambiguities. At the moment of a potential
              deduction, infants' pupils dilated, and their eyes moved toward
              the ambiguous object when inferences could be computed, in
              contrast to transparent scenes not requiring inferences to
              identify the object. These oculomotor markers resembled those of

              objects in parallel and one for representing and comparing large,
              approximate numerical magnitudes. We tested for dissociable
              neural signatures of these systems in preverbal infants, by
              recording event-related potentials (ERPs) as 6-7.5 month-old
              infants (n = 32) viewed dot arrays containing either small (1-3)
              or large (8-32) sets of objects in a number alternation paradigm.
              If small and large numbers are represented by the same neural
              system, then the brain response to the arrays should scale with
              ratio for both number ranges, a behavioral and brain signature of
              the approximate numerical magnitude system obtained in animals
              and in human adults. Contrary to this prediction, a mid-latency
              positivity (P500) over parietal scalp sites was modulated by the
              ratio between successive large, but not small, numbers.
              Conversely, an earlier peaking positivity (P400) over
              occipital-temporal sites was modulated by the absolute cardinal
              value of small, but not large, numbers. These results provide
              evidence for two early developing systems of non-verbal numerical

              objects and a second that responds to large quantities as

              words in 84 children that were classified as ``cardinal-principle

              that these children often do not know (1) which of two numbers in

               once they have been constructed by adults, how do children
               acquire them? While primarily focusing on the second question
               this book shows that the answers to both overlap substantially.
               The book begins by characterizing the innate starting point for
               conceptual development, namely systems of core cognition.
               Representations of core cognition are the output of dedicated
               input analyzers, as with perceptual representations, but these
               core representations differ from perceptual representations in
               having more abstract contents and richer functional roles. The
               book argues that the key to understanding cognitive development
               lies in recognizing conceptual discontinuities in which new
               representational systems emerge that have more expressive power
               than core cognition and are also incommensurate with core
               cognition and other earlier representational systems. Finally,

               that has been repeatedly sketched in the literature on the
               history and philosophy of science. It demonstrates that Quinian
               bootstrapping is a major mechanism in the construction of new

  abstract = "Coordinated studies of adults, infants, and nonhuman animals
              provide evidence for two systems of nonverbal number
              representation: a ``parallel individuation'' system that
              represents individual items and a ``numerical magnitude'' system
              that represents the approximate cardinal value of a group.
              However, there is considerable debate about the nature and
              functions of these systems, due largely to the fact that some
              studies show a dissociation between small (1-3) and large (>3)
              number representation, whereas others do not. Using event-related
              potentials, we show that it is possible to determine which system
              will represent the numerical value of a small number set (1-3
              items) by manipulating spatial attention. Specifically, when
              attention can select individual objects, an early brain response
              (N1) scales with the cardinal value of the display, the signature
              of parallel individuation. In contrast, when attention cannot
              select individual objects or is occupied by another task, a later
              brain response (P2p) scales with ratio, the signature of the
              approximate numerical magnitude system. These results provide
              neural evidence that small numbers can be represented as
              approximate numerical magnitudes. Further, they empirically
              demonstrate the importance of early attentional processes to
              number representation by showing that the way in which attention
              disperses across a scene determines which numerical system will

              this pattern of mother-infant exchange promotes the regulation of

              forms of social exchange including perspective taking and

              pairs also communicate intersubjectively via complex forms of
              emotional exchanges including exaggerated lipsmacking, sustained
              mutual gaze, mouth-mouth contacts, and neonatal imitation. Infant
              macaques solicit their mother's affiliative responses and

              simply passive recipients in such interaction. Thus, emotional
              communication between mother and infant is not uniquely human.
              Instead, we can trace back to macaques the evolutionary

  abstract = "Direct instruction facilitates learning without the costs of
              exploration, yet teachers must be selective because not
              everything can nor needs to be taught. How do we decide what to
              teach and what to leave for learners to discover? Here we
              investigate the cognitive underpinnings of the human ability to
              prioritize what to teach. We present a computational model that
              decides what to teach by maximizing the learner's expected
              utility of learning from instruction and from exploration, and we
              show that children (aged 5-7 years) make decisions that are
              consistent with the model's predictions (that is, minimizing the
              learner's costs and maximizing the rewards). Children flexibly
              considered either the learner's utility or their own, depending
              on the context, and even considered costs they had not personally
              experienced, to decide what to teach. These results suggest that
              utility-based reasoning may play an important role in curating

              understand beliefs, including false beliefs, at about 4-5 y of
              age, but recent studies using different response measures suggest
              that even infants (and apes!) have some skills as well. Resolving
              this discrepancy is not possible with current theories based on
              individual cognition. Instead, what is needed is an account
              recognizing that the key processes in constructing an
              understanding of belief are social and mental coordination with
              other persons and their (sometimes conflicting) perspectives.
              Engaging in such social and mental coordination involves
              species-unique skills and motivations of shared intentionality,

              shared intentionality account accords well with documented
              differences in the cognitive capacities of great apes and human

              for the development of mother-infant relationships. Some of these
              behaviors, such as the capacity of neonates to imitate adult
              facial movements, were previously thought to be limited to humans
              and perhaps the ape lineage. Here we report the behavioral
              responses of infant rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) to the
              following human facial and hand gestures: lip smacking, tongue
              protrusion, mouth opening, hand opening, and opening and closing
              of eyes (control condition). In the third day of life, infant
              macaques imitate lip smacking and tongue protrusion. On the first
              day of life, the model's mouth openings elicited a similar
              matched behavior (lip smacking) in the infants. These imitative
              responses are present at an early stage of development, but they
              are apparently confined to a narrow temporal window. Because lip
              smacking is a core gesture in face-to-face interactions in
              macaques, neonatal imitation may serve to tune infants'
              affiliative responses to the social world. Our findings provide a

              3 to 4 years of age (H. Wellman, D. Cross, \& J. Watson, 2001; H.
              Wimmer \& J. Perner, 1983), yet infants apparently pass
              false-belief tasks at 13 or 15 months (K. H. Onishi \& R.
              Baillargeon, 2005; L. Surian, S. Caldi, \& D. Sperber, 2007).
              Nonhuman animals also fail critical tests of belief reasoning but
              can show very complex social behavior (e.g., J. Call \& M.
              Tomasello, 2005). Fluent social interaction in adult humans
              implies efficient processing of beliefs, yet direct tests suggest
              that belief reasoning is cognitively demanding, even for adults
              (e.g., I. A. Apperly, D. Samson, \& G. W. Humphreys, 2009). The
              authors interpret these findings by drawing an analogy with the
              domain of number cognition, where similarly contrasting results
              have been observed. They propose that the success of infants and
              nonhuman animals on some belief reasoning tasks may be best
              explained by a cognitively efficient but inflexible capacity for
              tracking belief-like states. In humans, this capacity persists in

               sometimes amusing essay was originally published in 1950 in the
               leading philosophy journal Mind. Turing's friend Robin Gandy
               (like Turing a mathematical logician) said that `Computing
               Machinery and Intelligence'. . . was intended not so much as a
               penetrating contribution to philosophy but as propaganda. Turing
               thought the time had come for philosophers and mathematicians
               and scientists to take seriously the fact that computers were
               not merely calculating engines but were capable of behaviour
               which must be accounted as intelligent; he sought to persuade
               people that this was so. He wrote this paper---unlike his
               mathematical papers---quickly and with enjoyment. I can remember
               him reading aloud to me some of the passages--- always with a
               smile, sometimes with a giggle. The quality and originality of
               `Computing Machinery and Intelligence' have earned it a place
               among the classics of philosophy of mind. `Computing Machinery
               and Intelligence' contains Turing's principal exposition of the
               famous `imitation game' or Turing test. The test first appeared,
               in a restricted form, in the closing paragraphs of `Intelligent
               Machinery' (Chapter 10). Chapters 13 and 14, dating from 1951
               and 1952 respectively, contain further discussion and
               amplification; unpublished until 1999, this important additional
               material throws new light on how the Turing test is to be
               understood. The imitation game involves three participants: a
               computer, a human interrogator, and a human `foil'. The
               interrogator attempts to determine, by asking questions of the
               other two participants, which of them is the computer. All
               communication is via keyboard and screen, or an equivalent
               arrangement (Turing suggested a teleprinter link). The
               interrogator may ask questions as penetrating and wide-ranging
               as he or she likes, and the computer is permitted to do
               everything possible to force a wrong identification. (So the
               computer might answer `No' in response to `Are you a computer?'
               and might follow a request to multiply one large number by
               another with a long pause and a plausibly incorrect answer.) The

               identification.",

              path), goal (lifting an object vs. causing a change in its
              state), and causal structure (action on contact vs. action at a
              distance and after a delay). Prereaching infants showed no strong
              looking preference between a person's efficient and inefficient
              reaches when the person grasped and displaced an object. When the
              person reached for and caused a change in the state of the object

              this sensitivity reflects basic properties of the auditory system

               consider labels as referring to objects of like kind, rather
               than to objects that are thematically related: and (3) The
               mutual exclusivity assumption which leads children to expect

              that these two tasks--place recognition and heading
              retrieval--might be mediated by distinct cognitive systems in
              mice. Previous work has shown that numerous species, including
              young children and rodents, use the geometric shape of local
              space to regain their sense of direction after disorientation,
              often ignoring nongeometric cues even when they are informative.
              Notably, these experiments have almost always been performed in
              single-chamber environments in which there is no ambiguity about
              place identity. We examined the navigational behavior of mice in
              a two-chamber paradigm in which animals had to both recognize the
              chamber in which they were located (place recognition) and
              recover their facing direction within that chamber (heading
              retrieval). In two experiments, we found that mice used
              nongeometric features for place recognition, but simultaneously
              failed to use these same features for heading retrieval, instead
              relying exclusively on spatial geometry. These results suggest
              the existence of separate systems for place recognition and
              heading retrieval in mice that are differentially sensitive to
              geometric and nongeometric cues. We speculate that a similar

              and distant cues for orientation. The relative location of
              landmark and boundary was occasionally changed, with specific
              objects paired with one or other cue, allowing dissociation of
              learning and performance relative to either cue. Right posterior
              hippocampal activation reflected learning and remembering of
              boundary-related locations, whereas right dorsal striatal

              the exclusion of other cues [1-9]. Consistent with this
              behavioral work, neurons in brain structures that instantiate
              spatial memory often exhibit firing fields that are strongly
              controlled by environmental boundaries [10-15]. Despite the clear
              importance of environmental boundaries for spatial coding,
              however, a brain region that mediates the perception of boundary
              information has not yet been identified. We hypothesized that the
              occipital place area (OPA), a scene-selective region located near
              the transverse occipital sulcus [16], might provide this
              perceptual source by extracting boundary information from visual
              scenes during navigation. To test this idea, we used transcranial
              magnetic stimulation (TMS) to interrupt processing in the OPA

              with our prediction, we found that TMS to the right OPA impaired
              spatial memory for boundary-tethered, but not landmark-tethered,
              objects. Moreover, this effect was found when the boundary was
              defined by a wall, but not when it was defined by a marking on
              the ground. These results show that the OPA is causally involved
              in boundary-based spatial navigation and suggest that the OPA is

              must rely on external cues to regain her bearings, a process
              termed spatial reorientation. Extensive research has demonstrated
              that the geometric shape of the environment exerts powerful
              control over reorientation behavior, but the neural and cognitive
              mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not well understood.
              Whereas some theories claim that geometry controls behavior
              through an allocentric mechanism potentially tied to the
              hippocampus, others postulate that disoriented navigators reach
              their goals by using an egocentric view-matching strategy. To
              resolve this debate, we characterized hippocampal representations
              during reorientation. We first recorded from CA1 cells as
              disoriented mice foraged in chambers of various shapes. We found
              that the alignment of the recovered hippocampal map was
              determined by the geometry of the chamber, but not by
              nongeometric cues, even when these cues could be used to
              disambiguate geometric ambiguities. We then recorded hippocampal
              activity as disoriented mice performed a classical goal-directed
              spatial memory task in a rectangular chamber. Again, we found
              that the recovered hippocampal map aligned solely to the chamber

              the formation of attractor states in recurrent neural networks.
              In such networks, representations can be reactivated reliably
              from subsets of the cues that were present when the memory was
              encoded, at the same time as interference from competing
              representations is minimized. Theoretical studies have pointed to
              the recurrent CA3 system of the hippocampus as a possible
              attractor network. Consistent with predictions from these
              studies, experiments have shown that place representations in CA3
              and downstream CA1 tolerate small changes in the configuration of
              the environment but switch to uncorrelated representations when
              dissimilarities become larger. However, the kinetics supporting
              such network transitions, at the subsecond timescale, is poorly
              understood. Here we show in rats that instantaneous
              transformation of the spatial context does not change the
              hippocampal representation all at once but is followed by
              temporary bistability in the discharge activity of CA3 ensembles.
              Rather than sliding through a continuum of intermediate activity
              states, the CA3 network undergoes a short period of competitive
              flickering between preformed representations of the past and
              present environment before settling on the latter. Network
              flickers are extremely fast, often with complete replacement of
              the active ensemble from one theta cycle to the next. Within
              individual cycles, segregation is stronger towards the end, when
              firing starts to decline, pointing to the theta cycle as a
              temporal unit for expression of attractor states in the
              hippocampus. Repetition of pattern-completion processes across
              successive theta cycles may facilitate error correction and

              In two studies, we investigate the necessary and sufficient
              conditions for reversing this decline in foreign-language
              phonetic perception. In Experiment 1, 9-mo-old American infants

              Werker and Gerken (2002) has proposed a statistical account for

              Across several areas of cognitive science, researchers have
              identified cohesion as among the most important theoretical
              principles of object persistence: An object must maintain a
              single bounded contour over time. Drawing inspiration from recent
              work in adult visual cognition, the present study tested the
              power of cohesion as a constraint as it operates early in
              development. In particular, we tested whether the most minimal
              cohesion violation - a single object splitting into two - would
              destroy infants' ability to represent a quantity of objects over
              occlusion. In a forced-choice crawling paradigm, 10- and
              12-month-old infants witnessed crackers being sequentially placed
              into containers, and typically crawled toward the container with
              the greater cracker quantity. When one of the crackers was
              visibly split in half, however, infants failed to represent the
              relative quantities, despite controls for the overall quantities
              and the motions involved. This result helps to characterize the
              fidelity and specificity of cohesion as a fundamental principle

               three-dimensional surface arrangements and motions. Their

               figural goodness or to attend to nonaccidental geometric

               principles governing the motions of material bodies: Infants
               divide perceptual arrays into units that move as connected
               wholes, that move separately from one another, that tend to
               maintain their size and shape over motion, and that tend to act
               upon each other only on contact. These findings suggest that o

              learning have revealed that animals usually attend to parts and
              features of the discriminative stimuli rather than to global
              object properties. We provide here the first demonstration of

              available by filial imprinting, a process whereby young birds

              In Experiment 1, newborn chicks were reared singly with a red
              cardboard triangle, to which they rapidly imprinted and therefore
              treated as a social partner. On Day 3 of life, the chicks were
              presented with pairs of objects composed of either isolated
              fragments or occluded parts of the imprinting stimulus. Chicks
              consistently chose to associate with complete or with partly

              separate fragments of it. Similarly, in Experiment 2, chicks
              reared with a partly occluded triangle chose to associate with a

              the present experiments was to obtain converging evidence of
              object permanence in young infants. Experiments were conducted
              using paradigms previously used to demonstrate object permanence
              in 5.5-month-old infants and 6.5-month-old infants. In one
              experiment, 3.5-month-old infants watched a short or a tall
              carrot slide along a track. The track's center was hidden by a
              screen with a large window in its upper half. The short carrot
              was shorter than the window's lower edge and so did not appear in
              the window when passing behind the screen; the tall carrot was
              taller than the window's lower edge and hence should have
              appeared in the window but did not. The infants looked reliably
              longer at the tall than at the short carrot event, suggesting
              that they (a) represented the existence, height, and trajectory
              of each carrot behind the screen and (b) expected the tall carrot
              to appear in the screen window and were surprised that it did
              not. Control trials supported this interpretation. In another
              experiment, 4.0-month-old infants saw a toy car roll along a
              track that was partly hidden by a screen. A large toy mouse was
              placed behind the screen, either on top or in back of the track.
              The female infants looked reliably longer when the mouse stood on
              top as opposed to in back of the track, suggesting that they (a)
              represented the existence and trajectory of the car behind the
              screen, (b) represented the existence and location of the mouse
              behind the screen, and (c) were surprised to see the car reappear
              from behind the screen when the mouse stood in its path. A second
              experiment supported this interpretation. The results of these
              experiments provide further evidence that infants aged 3.5 months

              were reared singly with a small object that became their social
              partner. They were then accustomed to rejoin such an imprinting

              learning suggests a special role for the processing of discrete
              objects. But what counts as an object? Answers to this question
              often depend on contrasting object-based processing with the
              processing of spatial areas or unbound visual features. In infant
              cognition and word learning, though, another salient contrast has
              been between rigid cohesive objects and nonsolid substances.
              Whereas objects may move from one location to another, a nonsolid
              substance must pour from one location to another. In the study
              reported here, we explored whether attentive tracking processes
              are sensitive to dynamic information of this type. Using a
              multiple-object tracking task, we found that subjects could
              easily track four items in a display of eight identical
              unpredictably moving entities that moved as discrete objects from
              one location to another, but could not track similar entities
              that noncohesively ``poured'' from one location to another-even
              when the items in both conditions followed the same trajectories
              at the same speeds. Other conditions revealed that this inability
              to track multiple ``substances'' stemmed not from violations of
              rigidity or cohesiveness per se, because subjects were able to
              track multiple noncohesive collections and multiple nonrigid
              deforming objects. Rather, the impairment was due to the dynamic
              extension and contraction during the substancelike motion, which
              rendered the location of the entity ambiguous. These results
              demonstrate a convergence between processes of midlevel adult

               nature of the generalization occurring to untrained locations
               was then inspected to reveal the internal constraints. A new

               shift of one entire dimension with respect to the other.
               Training with two pairs caused linear interpolation to all

                 Many advances have come from using deep neural networks
                 trained end-to-end in tasks such as object recognition, video
                 games, and board games, achieving performance that equals or

                 biological inspiration and performance achievements, these
                 systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We
                 review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly
                 human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach
                 beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn and

                 explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving
                 pattern recognition problems; (2) ground learning in intuitive
                 theories of physics and psychology to support and enrich the
                 knowledge that is learned; and (3) harness compositionality
                 and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize
